              <h2>#1 Types of Transparency</h2>
              <p>Motivation: When considering transparency, it is important to understand who you are being transparent toward, and what you are being transparent about.</p>
              <p>What to Do: 
              Consider the following...
              <p><li>Are you trying to understand something? (Internal transparency)</li></p>
              <p><li>Are you trying to explain something? (External transparency)</li></p>
              <p><li>Are you trying to understand or explain how the system works? (Transparency of algorithms and data)</li></p>
              <p><li>Are you trying to understand or explain why the system was made to be the way it is now? (Transparency of system development)</li></p>
              <p><li>External stakeholders to consider, among other: (end-)users, safety certification agencies, accident investigators, lawyers or expert witnesses, and society at large for disruptive technologies.</li></p>
