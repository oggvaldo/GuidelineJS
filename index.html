              <p>Motivation: In order to understand the big picture, it is important to first understand who the system can affect and how. Try to also think past the obvious, direct stakeholders such as your end-users.</p>
              <p>What to Do: Identify stakeholders.</p>
              <p><li>Who does the system affect and how? Stakeholders are not simply users, developers and customers.</li></p>
              <p><li>How are the various stakeholders linked together?</li></p>
              <p><li>Can these different stakeholders influence the development of the system? How?</li></p>
              <p><li>Remember that a user is ofthen an organization and the end-user is an individual. Similarly, AI systems can treat people as objects for data colection.</li></p>
              <p><b>Practical Example:</b> Autonomous cars don't just affect ther passengers. Anyone mearby is affected; some even change the way they drive. If at one point half of the traffic consists of selt-driving cars, what are the societal impacts of such systems? E.g., how are the people who can't afford one affected? Regulations arising from such systems are also affect everyone.</p>
